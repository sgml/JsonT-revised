# JsonT - Revised #

JsonT - Revised is a version of [http://goessner.net/articles/jsont/](http://goessner.net/articles/jsont/) with more verbose syntax, all uses of [eval()](http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#evil) removed and commented in the [JSDocs](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/) format.

## Intention ##

JsonT is a brilliant use of JavaScript and a very flexible and small templating engine. There is no reason for it to use eval().

My intention was to produce a version that was easier to read and more secure. I also include a minified version for production which was minified using the [YUI compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) (with semi-colons preserved). 

### Note for Stefan Goessner ###

I attempted to contact you re. adding this to Github but could not find how to do this. My work with JsonT is intended as a tribute to it and hope you see it as such. Please let me know if you have any objections to it being hosted in this way.
